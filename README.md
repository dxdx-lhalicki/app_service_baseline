# Azure Web Application Architecture with Terraform

Deploy a highly available, scalable, and zone-redundant web application on Azure using Terraform. This repository structures the deployment into reusable Terraform modules, enabling flexibility and ease of management.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Azure App Service**: Hosts your web application, automatically scaling based on traffic and offering seamless deployment slots for staging and production environments.

2. **Azure Application Gateway**: Acts as the entry point for all HTTP/S traffic. It routes requests to the App Service while ensuring security with a built-in Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

3. **Azure SQL & Storage**: Provides a secure and redundant backend. Azure SQL Database serves as the primary database for structured data, and Azure Storage offers blob, table, and queue services for unstructured data. Both services are zone-redundant, ensuring high availability even during regional failures.

4. **Azure Key Vault**: Stores sensitive information such as database connection strings and API keys. This ensures that secrets are securely managed and can be rotated without needing code changes.

5. **Private Endpoints**: Provides secure communication between the App Service, databases, and other Azure services. By using private endpoints, all communication happens over a private network within Azure, preventing exposure to the public internet.

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request**: End users send HTTP/S requests, which are received by the **Application Gateway**.

2. **Traffic Routing**: The **Application Gateway** uses load balancing and WAF policies to route incoming traffic securely to the **App Service**.

3. **Web Application Processing**: The App Service processes the request, interacting with **Azure SQL** for structured data and **Azure Storage** for unstructured data as needed.

4. **Secret Management**: During application runtime, secrets like database connection strings are fetched from **Azure Key Vault**, ensuring that no sensitive information is hard-coded.

5. **Private Communication**: All interactions between the App Service and other services (e.g., SQL, Storage) happen over **Private Endpoints**, ensuring secure communication within Azure's internal network.

6. **Response**: The web application processes the user request and returns the response via the **Application Gateway** back to the client.

## Prerequisites

- Azure account
- Terraform installed locally

## Key Considerations

- **Zone Redundancy**: The architecture is designed to be resilient across availability zones.
- **Secure Access**: Private endpoints ensure secure communication between services, with no exposure to the public internet.
- **Scalability**: The App Service scales automatically based on traffic demand.
- **Governance**: Leverages Azure’s policies and role-based access controls to ensure security and governance principles.
